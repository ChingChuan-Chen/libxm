libxm
=====

Libxm is a library designed to provide an efficient contraction of huge (on
order of terabytes) disk-based block-tensors with arbitrary symmetry and
sparsity. If tensors are stored on hard disk they are asynchronously prefetched
to main memory for fast access. Libxm uses completely asynchronous new
algorithm to do this as efficiently as possible. Optimized BLAS implementation
is used to perform actual contractions and can be efficiently accelerated
using GPUs or other accelerators like Intel Xeon Phi. Libxm reaches close to
peak performance even in cases where data size is much larger than the
available amount of fast random access memory.

To compile libxm you need a sane POSIX environment, an efficient BLAS library,
and an ANSI C complaint compiler. See Makefile for sample compiler flags and
configurations.

See benchmark.c file for sample code using libxm. To start using libxm in your
project simply add xm.c to the project files and include xm.h to get function
definitions. Detailed API documentation can be found in xm.h file.
